Profiles allow you to set specific input mappings on a per game basis when a matching executable is found. Default Profile is used when no match is found.

## Profile Settings

### Disable Lizard Mode
Lizard mode allows the Steam Deck Controller to fall back to its lizard brain (mouse and keyboard emulation). When this mode is not marked as disabled the right trackpad is used for mouse movement, the right trigger is the left mouse button, and the dpad emulates the up, down, left, and right arrow keys of the keyboard. Place a checkmark in the box to disable Lizard Mode (disabling can prevent double input in games that use the dpad). 

## Axis Mappings
Axis mappings allow you to assign control to any Steam Deck hardware button with an axis to any Xbox controller axis button.

### Hardware Button
The physical button on the Steam Deck that you would like to assign virtual input to.

### Emulated Axis
The virtual axis you would like emulated for the hardware button.

### Activation Button
Assigns another button that must be pressed to activate the emulation.

### Inverted
Select inverted if you would like the inputs reversed (left is right, up is down, etc.) - useful if game does not support inversion natively.
